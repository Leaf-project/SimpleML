#       SimpleML
Machine learning model in c++. Main methode : Gradient descent (1st derivative).
Other methodes : Study of other levels of derivatives like 2nd or -1nd (anti-derivative).

## Structure of model in c++
T - type of data (float, double, long double ...)
Array : any dimention and any length.
  -Data : vector<type>
  -Shape : the 'dimention" of array
Var: Each variable is an Array.
  -time : vector of Array<T>
Memory: Code and vector of Var<T>
  - datas : vector of variables
  - code: 'math' code
    - code : brut text split in list of lines
    - fnlines : list of lines of functions declarations (all ':')
    - argsid : list of all args variables 'names'
    - main : with functions to execute first (the MAIN function)
Model: List of all functions (f-1, f0, f1 ...)
  - levels : from smaller n of var to bigger
  - relativ (witch is the MAIN functions (f[0]) (where -1 is anti-derivativ and 1 is first derivative)

## Code
### Content
Code is just a list of operation. Each variable is show as 'id' (position in Memory.datas)
To compute 3x+1 we store like this { {x}, {3.0}, {1} } then : 0 | 1 * 2 +  ((0|), (1*), (2+))
Operators:
  - '|' - set target
  - ')' - call functions
  - '+' - add
  - '-' - sub
  - '*' - mul
  - '/' - div
  - '^' - pow
  - '@' - dot product
  - 'a' - sum of array (Î£ ) *not implemented*
  - 's' - sub of array *not implemented*
  - 'd' - div of array *not implemented*
  - 'm' - mul of array
### Funcs
Functions declatation:

```
argument_id:   <- declaration
...code
return_var_id# <- end
```

First decladed function is named 0, second 1 ...
To call first func : 0)

### Example 
Logistic functions
```
logistic(x) = 1 / ( 1 + e**(-x) )
```
With data : 0.0:1 / 2.718281828459045:1 / -1.0:1 / 1.0:1 / 0.0:1   ('/' separate each variables in form of {lis of values}:{shape})
```
0:
0|2*
4|1=0^3+2^
4#
```
$(0) - is argument x, $(1) - is euler number, $(2) is -1 (to make -x), $(3) is 1, $(4) is a temporaty value

## Exec
Use bin/compute.exe to execute some code with arguments : config_file and level_exec  (actually for compiled for linux, to make for windows : g++ compute.cpp -o bin/compute.exe
